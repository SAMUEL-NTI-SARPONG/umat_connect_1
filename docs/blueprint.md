## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light indigo (#7986CB) evokes a sense of trust, institutionality, and clarity. Indigo reflects the seriousness of an academic institution while remaining accessible.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#EDE7F6), same hue family as indigo, providing a clean, calming backdrop without drawing focus away from content. This scheme lends itself to displaying photos, like user profile pictures.
- Accent color: Muted blue-violet (#673AB7), to bring definition and highlights to key interface elements like buttons and interactive elements, without overwhelming the softer primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, simple icons, similar to WhatsApp and Instagram, to maintain familiarity and ease of use.
- Adapt the familiar layout patterns of WhatsApp and Instagram, such as tab-based navigation, list views for posts and messages, and profile layouts, to ensure a user-friendly experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and loading states, providing smooth feedback and enhancing the user experience.
